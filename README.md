# Getting Started with Custom Hooks in React

To get started initialize a react app with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Notes on Custom hooks
#### A hook is basically a function that allows you to abstract some logic in react. Difference between a `hook` and a `function` is that a `hook` allows you to access state and other react component lifecyle whilst in a normal `function` its not possible 
Custom hooks has 3 rules:

*Must start with `use` keyword e.g useToggle
*Has to be at the highest level of a component
*Should be inside a component and not a function
